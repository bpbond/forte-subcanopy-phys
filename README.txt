README for FoRTE-subcanopy-phys
Author: Lisa T. Haber

This repository is for 2018 FoRTE subcanopy leaf physiological data integration and processing. All data files are obtained through Google Drive (FoRTE/data/subcanopy_leaf_physiology).These data files were generated in summer (July-August) of 2018 using a LI-6400XT infrared gas analyzer to obtain light- and CO2-saturated maximum photosynthetic rates of understory leaves (1-2m from ground) in FoRTE vegetation survey plots.

Species codes, sampling protocols, etc available on OSF/FoRTE: https://osf.io/z8x73/
